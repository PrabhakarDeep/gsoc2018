## Things to discuss w/ Frederik:
- Does he know anything about running multibuildpacks on Heroku? Node.js AND Python? Alternatives?
- Bot participation mechanism? Currently simple and restricted #HashtagMention / @mention. Alternatively listen on stream for keywords and analyze whether to participate?
- Seed package name? Seed is already taken on NPM
- Saving NMF and LDA model for later - any techniques? Using scikit-learn implementation ATM but can switch easily.
