        Notes about the interaction: 
          - Multiple users engaged in discussion, OP did not so far (14:33 on 13/07/2018)
          - There was multitude of opinions, out of 3 participating users one was pro-topic (pro-Trump) and two against
          - The discussion that followed was not riddled with expletives but was managed in argumentative style with facts and evidence being presented and commented on
          - The discussion appears to be still going on so more insights will be drawn at a later time. Participation is paused for now.
        - AFTER SOME TIME OBSERVING DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWED:
          - The debate continues and is still very opinionated.
          - The OP that the initial reply was made to has still not participated.
          - Arguments are presented, sometimes more calmly, sometimes more heatedly.
          - There is minimum of profanities but the debate is taking a more and more personal turn.
          - The debate still revolves around original topic ('Trump') but follows a very specific path rather than talking about general concepts.
          - There are no apparent ways for participation in debate from a bot perspective.
          - Disengagement is possibly the best option.
            - No disengagement message seems like a best strategy. (Too many parties and their debate probably still not over.)
